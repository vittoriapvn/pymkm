# pyMKM

`pyMKM` is an open-source Python package for computing microdosimetric quantities using MKM, SMK, and OSMK models.  
It is designed for use in radiobiology research and clinical applications in hadrontherapy.

## 📦 Features

- Dose and LET-based microdosimetric modeling
- MKM, SMK, and OSMK formulations
- Support for amorphous track structure models (Kiefer-Chatterjee, Scholz-Kraft)
- Automatic table generation for survival calculation
- Full test coverage with `pytest`

```bash
pip install pymkm
```

From source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/BeppMagro/pymkm.git
cd pymkm
pip install -e .[dev]
```
