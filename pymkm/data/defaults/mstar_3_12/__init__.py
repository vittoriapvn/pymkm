Stopping power tables from MSTAR 3.12.

This set includes LET data obtained using the MSTAR code (version 3.12),
commonly used in heavy ion dosimetry.

Each file contains stopping power values for a specific ion, tabulated
as energy (MeV/u) vs. LET (MeV/cm), for water as the reference medium.

The data is used internally by pyMKM for benchmarking and default modeling.
